      </li>
      <li>
        What are the type of transfers?<br />
        Parallel: Multiple bits transferred simultaneously, high speed, $$$, problems with long distance<br />
        Serial: Single wire to send data one bit at a time, slower speed, $, synchronous or asynchronous
      </li>
      <li>
        What is synchronous serial?<br />
        Data is sent along with a clock signal so receiver know when data is valid. Higher speed but requires additional lines
      </li>
      <li>
        What is asynchronous serial?<br />
        No clock signal is sent. Sender and receiver must agree on baud rate (bps). Special signaling is required to synchronize sender/receiver.
      </li>
      <li>
        How do directions work in Serial?<br />
        Simplex: One way direction<br />
        Half Duplex: one way OR the other at a time<br />

        Data Register: Contains the data about to be read/written<br />
        Status Register: Contains the interrupt disable bits, status bits (ready or not) <br />
      </li>
        <li>
        What is Program Controlled I/O (PCI/O)? <br/>
        A procedure checks device's status then moves data (in or out). Slow because the CPU is tied up. Faster devices will cause problems.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is a Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC)?<br/>
        Unit that takes control of the memory bus, store data from I/O device directly in memory and wait for next byte/word to arrive. Connected to the memory bus and to an I/O Controller. The CPU provides the start address in memory, the word count, the function (Read/Write) and the address of I/O Device (if required).
        </li>
        <li>
        What is inside a DMAC?<br/>
        Data Count Register: Contains the number of DMA data transfers to be performed. e.g amount of words<br/>
        Data Register: Contains the data about to be read/written<br/>
        Address Register (ADDR): Address of the unit on the memory bus<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
        What are the three different architectures for DMACs?<br/>
        Detached: Single memory bus with all devices and DMAC connected<br/>
        Integrated: I/O Devices are connected directly to the DMAC, DMAC connected to single memory bus<br/>
        I/O Bus: DMAC connected to memory bus and I/O Bus, All I/O devices connected to I/O bus
        </li>
        <li>
        How does PCI/O compare to DMA?<br/>
        PCI/O : $ Simple Slow CPU tied up<br/>
        DMA: $$$ Requires facilities for Address generators, control signals, data bus system. Large for large amount of data stored into continuous memory locations. Required Bus arbitration (Who controls the memory bus). 
        </li>
        <li>
        What is an Interrupt Request (IRQ)?<br/>
            Exception thrown when an I/O device receives data. Interrupts the user to run the Interrupt Service Routine and then gives back control to the user. Needs IRQ line(s).
        </li>
        <li>
        What are the architectures with IRQ Lines?<br/>
        Single IRQ Line: CPU pools status bit of each device, priority assigned by order, Slow, all device connected to a single line, no multiple requests.<br/>
        Multiple IRQ Lines: Has several different IRQ lines (for each priority). Priority assigned to various lines. Service higher priority requests first.
        </li>
        <li>
        What are Vectored Interrupts?<br/>
        Devices indicate to CPU where to find ISR start address. Requires an INTR vector between CPU and device.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is Daisy-Chain hardware polling?<br/>
        The ACK signal is connected to one device, which transmits it to another and so on until interrupt device found. Then return through next devices to CPU (if Vectored, return is ISR address).
        </li>
        <li>
        How are Interrupts controlled?<br/>
        CPU: Enabling of interrupts(ACK), Priority structure, Masking of interrupts<br/>
        Device: Enable IRQ bit in control register
        </li>
        <li>
        How do IRQs work in ARM?<br/>
        There are two interrupt lines (I and F) which can be disabled in the CPSR.<br/>
        User mode is not priviledged and cannot manipulate these bits<br/>
        System mode and the five exception modes are privileged
        </li>
        <li>
        What are the 7 types od exceptions in ARM?<br/>
        1: Powerup/reset-> enters supervisor mode
        2: Data access violation (abort)
        3: Fast Interrupt (FIQ)
        4: Ordinary interrupt (IRQ)
        5: Instruction access violation (abort)
        6: Unimplemented Instruction (undefined)
        7: ...
        ?: Software interrupt-> enters supervisor mode
        </li>
        <li>
        What is FIQ used for?<br/>
        Few devices that require urgent service. General purpose registers(R8-R12, R13, R14) are replaced with banked registers after the ISR.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is IRQ used for?<br/>
        Used for "normal" interrupts. Only R13/14 are replaced with banked registers after ISR executed. Must push/pop registers to change them.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is register banking?<br/>
         Purpose: Not push/pop on memory (because it's slow)
         Register banking is having multiple registers linked to the same memory address. When an exception occur, a switch is made to one of 5 exception modes (IRQ, FIQ, Undefined, Abort, supervisor) with some registers replaced with banked registers.
        </li>
        <li>
        How does the memory bus work?<br/>
        It contains three classes of lines:<br/>
            Data: Data transferred<br/>
            Address: Memory target<br/>
            Control: Read/Write etc.<br/>
        At any time, there is only one device that controls the bus: Bus Master<br/>
        Bus Arbitration is required if there are multiple devices that can be Bus Master<br/>
        Two main methods:<br/>
        Centralized Arbitration<br/>
        Distributed Arbitration<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            What is Centralized Arbitration?<br>
            CPU supervises control of bus. E.g multiple DMAC in daisy chain
        </li>
        <li>
            What is Distributed Arbitration? <br/>
            One or more devices activate the Start Arbitration signal and each device bids for control of the bus by placing the bits of its ID on an arbitration bus. All competing devices look for their address on the bus. The highest address wins control and that device will drop out of competition until all devices have had a chance to control the bus.
        </li>
        <li>
            What are the specifications of a synchronous Bus?<br/>
            Common clock line for all devices that is long enough to accomodate slowest device. Memory clock is much slower than CPU clock (1 memCyc = 4-5 cpuCyc). Need to add signals to allow device to tell master when it is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            What are the specifications of an async Bus?<br/>
            Faster, master and slave use a handshake to do transfers. Need Master-ready and Slave-ready signals.
        </li>
        <li>
            What is a device's interface?<br/>
            Inputs to registers can always listen to the bus.  Only clocked when addressed.<br/>
            Output from register are only transferred to the bus when required(tri-state drivers)<br/>
            Each device will require address decoding and control signal generation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Draw an 8-bit parallel interface.<br/>
            <img src="img/8bitParallel.JPG" width="500px"/>
        </li>
        <li>
            What is a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Bus?<br/>
            One of the first standard interface independent of processor.<br/>
            Device attached to PCI bus "appear" as if they are connected directly to the processor bus<br/>
            "Plug-and-play"<br/>
            Signaling is a master/slave relationship
        </li>
        <li>
            What are the three address spaces PCI supports?<br/>
            Memory<br/>
            I/O<br/>
            Configuration: Each device has a configuration Read-Only Memory (ROM) that holds info about the device.<br/>
             A 4bit command accompanies a data transfer to indicate which space is to be used.

        What is Universal Serial Bus(USB) ?<br/>
        Collaborative standard<br/>
        Supports two speeds: 1.5Mbps and 12Mbps<br/>
        Speeds augmented through standards (e.g. Thunderbolt = 40Gbps)<br/>
        Serial bus<br/>
        USB uses a tree structure. Each hubs are connected to other hubs and I/O devices. This makes it faster to find a device. A hub copies a message from its upstream connection to all of its downstream connections<br/>
        Inexpensive hubs since no real arbitration is required<br/>
        When a device is connected to the system. it assumes address 0<br/>
        When a device is detected, a handshake process takes place to determin the characteristics of the device<br/>
        Two types of packets exchanged: control and data<br/>
        Control packets: address, ack, errors, etc<br/>
        Packets have PID that identifies its type (4bits transmitted twice)<br/>

        How are memory systems implemented?<br/>
        Memory chips are not large enough by themselves. Systems use a grid of chips<br/>
        Memory access time is the time between access request and completion<br/>
        Memory cycle time is time between successive operations<br/>
        For consecutive memory locations, we need to wait each successive access to complete
        </li>
        <li>
        What is the fastest systems implementation for consecutive memory locations?<br/>

        How does cache memory improve performance in memory systems?<br/>
        Cache memory is small amount of fast memory places physically close to the processor.<br/>
        Smaller than main memory.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is a Direct Mapped Cache System?<br/>
        To place main memory's content in Cache, we place main memory's block x in cache's block<br/>
        x % N with N being the size of cache.<br/>
        Slows the system down to replace them continuously.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is Associative memory?<br/>
        Blocks of memory can be places in any blocks of cache. More flexible<br/>
        More efficient since we never replace blocks unless all blocks are in use.<br/>
        Mapping hardware is more complex. To see if a word is in cache, all blocks must be checked.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is Set-Associative mapping?<br/>
        Compromise between Direct and Associative mapping. <br/>
        (x) -> (x % N) + k<br/>
        N is not the size of cache and k is any number.<br/>
        When dealing with hardware, no need to check all blocks. Similar to hashtable
        </li>
        <li>
        What are possible replacement algorithms?<br/>
        Least Recently Used(LRU): 2 bit counter to keep track of block "age"<br/>
        When hit occurs, referenced block couter becomes 0 and blocks with counters lower than referenced block are incremented, others remain the same.<br/>
        When miss occurs, if set is not full, new block counter is 0 and all otherss incremented.<br/>
        When miss occurs, and set is full, block with counter = 0x11 is replaces then counter set to 0 and others incremented<br/>
        FIFO: worst performance<br/>
        Random: Good performance
        </li>
        <li>
        What is a cache hit, miss and what is the Average Memory Access time?<br/>
        Hit: request is made for a word and it is present<br/>
        Miss: not there<br/>
        \(T_{avg} =hC + (1-h)M\)<br/>
        Where<br/>
        h : hit rate<br/>
        C : Cache Access Time <br/>
        M : Main memory Accesss Time<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
        How can you decrease Tavg?<br/>
        Increase hit rate (h): Larger block size, higher associativity, prefetching<br/>
        Decrease C: Small and simple cache, decrease distance to cache, Faster tag checking<br/>
        Reduce M : Optimal sub-block placement, early restart, Multiple levels of cache, Lock-up-free cache
        </li>
        <li>
        Given a 10 clock cycles DRAM with 17 cycles to load a block into cache and 30% of instructions perform R/W. Assume a cache with0.95 hit rate for instructions and 0.9 for data and same miss penalty for R and W. How much time does an implementation without cache takes more than with cache?<br/>
        \(\frac{\text{time without cache}}{\text{time with cache}}=\frac{130\times 10}{100(0.95\times 1 + 0.05\times17)+30(0.9\times1+0.1\times17)}\)
        </li>
        <li>
        What is the Tavg for a two level cache?<br/>
        \(T_{avg}=h_1C_1+(1-h_1)(h_2C_2)+(1-h_1)(1-h_2)M\)
        </li>
        <li>
        What is a Write Buffer?<br/>
        Temporary storage of write requests processed only when memory has no read requests.<br/>
        Must compare read addresses to write addresses to prevent read of outdated data.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is write-back protocol?<br/>
        If data in block has not been written back to main memory and it must be replaced and we have a temporary write buffer, we can transfer that "dirty" block in buffer and load the new block in cache. Then the dirty block is written to main memory
        </li>
        <li>
        What is Prefetching?<br/>
        Add a prefetch instruction to processor when read miss would occur.<br/>
        Can be done by prgrammer, compiler, even hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is Lockup-Free cache?<br/>
        Prefetch can be as if it interferes with normal execution. e.g lock the cache by provoquing cache miss. We can introduce more cicuitry to allow processor to access cache while a miss is serviced. That means we can miss more than once. Needs a counter to keep track of miss that require service.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is virtual memory?<br/>
        If program does not fit in physical memory, parts of it must be kept on secondary storage (e.g. disk). CPU generates a virtual address or logical addresses.<br/>
        Virtual Addresses: Relative to the program itself. Must be translated into physical addresses.<br/> It uses the Memory Management Unit (MMU)<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
        How does Address translation works?<br/>
        Divide program into fixed-size pages. In the Virtual Address, the upper bits are the Virtual Page Number and the Lower Bits are the location (offset) within page. Page Table has entries decribing statius of each page: Validity(is it loaded in main memory?), Modified while resident?, Access control of page?
        </li>
        <li>
        What does the MMU do?<br/>
        Used in every R/W operation. Complexity depends on Page table. Implemented as part of the CPU. Not all page tables can be kept in MMU, some must be kept in Main Memory. A portion is kept in MMU for most recently accessed pages : Translation Lookaside Buffer(a small cache)<br/>
        With high probability, next address requested is sequential. We can use special registers to hold last virtual page number and physical page and we don't need to go to TLB

        </li>
        <li>
        What is the Access time for Magnetic Hard Disks?<br/>
        Seek time: Time required to move the heads to proper track<br/>

        What are RAID configurations?<br/>
        RAID0: Split (or stripe) data over 2 or more disks. Improves performance<br/>
        RAID1: Mirrors data on a second disk: Data lost if both disks fail<br/>
        RAID2: Data is striped at the bit level. Error correcting code is used to spread the data over several disks. If an error occurs, it can be corrected<br/>
        RAID3: Byte level striping with a dedicated parity (error correction) disk<br/>
        RAID4: Block level striping with a dedicated parity disk and can allow simultaneous access to different blocks.<br/>
        RAID5: Block level striping with parity distributed over all of the disks<br/>
        RAID6: Extension of RAID5 with another parity block. Allows two concurrent failures

        Subtract exponents and add bias. <br/>
        Divide Mantissas, normalize result
        </li>
        <li>
        How are floating points truncated?<br/>
        Chopping: Just chop it off! Error is always negative, at most 1 LSB<br/>
        Von Neumann Rounding: If guard bits are non zero, then increment LSB. Error is centered around value.<br/>

        What are the control signals required for a Basic CPU design for each of the internal register sets?<br/>
        XXin: read and/or latch data from the bus<br/>
        XXout: drives the bus with data from a register (one at a time)<br/>
        Where XX is the register (e.g. MARin). The bus is the CPU's bus.
        </li>
        <li>
        How does instruction execution work?<br/>
        1. PC is pointing to start of instruction in memory<br/>
        2. Transfer the content of that location into the Instruction Register (IR)<br/>
        3. Circuitry translates the instruction code into a series of sequential operations

        </li>
        <li>
        How many registers do you need for the ALU?<br/>
        Only 2. One for operand A and one for the result Z. The Operand B can be loaded directly from the bus and won't be written to Rz until the control signal Zin is active. There is also a Multiplexer between Ry (one of the inputs) and the ALU to select between the value Ry and an immediate value.
        </li>
        <li>
        Draw the connections and control signals for register MDR between the Internal processor bus and the memory bus.<br/>

        </li>
        <li>
        What are the MFC and WMFC control signals?<br/>
        MFC: Stands for Memory Function Complete. It is sent from memory to the CPU when memory has finished an operation, so that CPU knows it is available on bus.<br/>
        WMFC: Just wait for MFC
